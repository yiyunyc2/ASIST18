### ABSTRACT
The era of big science promises rapid growth of scientific innovations and complex problem-solving, bringing forth the practice of doing science in large-scale collaborative effort rather than single author, solitary work. In disciplines such as genomics and high-energy physics, it is not uncommon that hyperauthorship phenomenon with the amount of authors soaring high from hundredth to thousandth. The purpose of this research is to explore the collaboration dynamics and the partial alphabetical author byline in one of the primary research article within the Human Genome Project (HGP). Using co- authorship network analysis, we find that middle authors play crucial roles in facilitating collaboration among previously unconnected authors as well as contributing to genetic sequencing efforts. Future work entails network analysis of all published works by HGP to comprehensively capture collaboration dynamics among multiple research centers.
